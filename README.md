# Memory_101
Simple C programs to help understand memory allocation
 ## getting started
 On a mac, with Developer Tools installed, you should be able to do the following commands to compile and run a C program from a command shell or terminal window.
 - cd to a place where you keep clones of git repositories.
 - Clone this one: mac> git clone git@github.com:chrisroederucdenver/Memory_101.git
 -  cd into Memory_101
 -  gcc <file.c>
 - ./a.out
